# Split-Hyperspectral-Image-into-Separate-Bands
If you are working with hyperspectral images and need to access specific single bands, using this tool would be helpful.
Using this tool is quite straightforward. Simply open it in ArcGIS Pro, select your hyperspectral image (which should be in .bil format), choose the output directory (a folder) where you want to save the results, and then run the tool while observing the results.
